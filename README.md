# SudokuGenerator
This project contains Everything you can think about a sudoku puzzle. Generators, Solvers and Visualizer as ".jpg" images...


As you can see, there are 2 folders. One for C++ and one for Python. 
There are 2 main differences between these versions: 
  * Python (3.7) code has a ui that you can give commands like generating sudoku puzzle, visualising the given sudoku puzzle or solving the given puzzle. But when you run it it is pretty slow according to the C++ version. 
  * C++ code was written in CodeBlocks and to be honest I am a bit new to C++. So I don't quite know that there are any differences between IDE's because of the compilers. But it is pretty fast if you run it. It generates Sudoku Puzzles in just a few seconds. 

Main logic behind the algorithm is backtracking. While creating the puzzle or checking if there are any solutions or more than 1 solution, the whole logic can be explained with recursive algorithms and backtracking. I hope You like it. 
Thanks
